## Literature Review

### Backgrounds

Sequencing microbiome genome provides insights in understanding biological and medical problems. Microbiome genomic studies enable to achieve tasks like evaluating the abundance of bacteria and spotting the unknown from environmental samples {{Yu 2017}}, human microbiome reconstruction {{Pasolli 2019}}, etc. With these new methods and tools, properties of microbial communities and their connections to environment {{Yu 2017, Seeleuthner 2018}} and human health {{Galkin 2018, Pasolli 2019}} can be revealed. Such studies require practicing of the Next-Generation genome sequencing, which concerns technological challenges in both biological and computational aspects. {{Gawad 2015}}

There are two approaches in microbiome genomic studies depending on the genome subjects: (a) metagenome, whose subject is the microbial community in the environment {{Tringe 2005}} and  (b) single-cell, which performs sequencing on isolated individual cells or species. {{Gawad 2015, Tringe 2005}} 

In both cases, the current-state sequencing methods produce data in large scales and advanced algorithms in combinatorics and data science must be employed to make efficient and effective use of the biological data.

#### Biological Background

##### DNA and Genome

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a type of macromolecule consisting of two chains, forming a double helix structure. Each strand of the DNA molecule is a long sequence built up with nucleotides. One end of the strand is named 5’ end, and the other is named 3’ end. The two strands go opposite directions. There are four types of nucleotides, differentiated by their bases (A, C, G, T). The two chains of the DNA molecule are complementary according to the base pairing rule (A–C, G–T). DNA encodes the genetic information.

The DNA segment that encodes certain protein is called the gene of the protein. The term “gene” also include the non-coding control regions on a DNA molecule. Genome is the whole set of DNA molecules of an organism. {{Understanding Bioinformatics}}

##### The Next-Generation Sequencing

DNA sequencing techniques are applied to determine the nucleotide order in DNA. The very first DNA sequencing technology was as early as 1970s, typically the Sanger Sequencing. Since the mid 1990s, a few new sequencing methods emerged, and these methods are called “next-generation” or “second-generation” sequencing methods.

The DNA sequencing methods do not work out the whole genome for once. Instead, only parts of the DNA can be sequenced each time, and the lengths of the outputs depend on the methods. The direct output sequences of the sequencing procedure are called “reads” in the context.

Read length and the number of reads per run are two factors to assess the performance of a sequencing method. One of the commercial high-throughput sequencing methods is implemented by Illumina, which can reach 300 bp (base-pair) for highest average read length and ~10^9^ reads / run for speed {{Hodkinson 2014}}. The Illumina *de novo* sequencing (no reference sequence available for aligning the reads) is used in the study.

The amplification process is necessary for the single molecules to amplify the radioactive or fluorescent tags. The signals are recorded in a series of digital images, the dots are the clusters corresponding to the unique DNA segments. The sequencing results are inferred from the images.

The reads will then be used for data analysis. Common tasks are assembly of the reads to longer contigs (contiguous sequences), alignment to the known genome, binning (combining) the contigs to species level, etc. {{An introduction to Next-Generation Sequencing Technology}} All of the tasks require computational efforts, and will be discussed later.


#### Current Microbiome Genomic Methods

##### Metagenome

The metagenome approach to microbiome genomic studies concern sequencing of samples with mixed cells from environmental or artificial {{Yu 2017}} microbial communities. We here draft an outline of a typical metagenome method in a microbiome genomic research.

##### Single-Cell

Cell sources in single-cell researches may not vary much from the metagenome approach, however the cell isolation and the whole-genome amplification processes must be introduced. {{Gawad 2015}}

#### Computational Aspects

The next-generation DNA sequencing and the data analysis of it concerns methods in data science. This part sums up what the data to be analyses looks like, what operations will be performed on the data, how these operations are done, and what are the computational challenges behind them.

##### Properties of the Input Data

* The reads are strings on characters A, C, G and T.
* The reads have overlaps, and this information helps to do the assembly, i.e. combining the short reads to longer sequences.
* Part of the reads are on the complementary strand to the others. For example, if the sequence of a strand is ACCGGGTTTT, then its complementary strand is AAAACCCGGT. {{See: Biological Background / DNA and Genome}} And when you are getting reads for 5 bp long, you may see both ACCGG and AAAAC in the result.
* The reads are not always identical to some subsequence of the reference / expected genome, since errors may occur in the replication of a DNA molecule, as well as in the sequencing process.
* The quality of the sequencing are recorded per nucleotide. See FASTQ file format specification for details. {{Cock 2010}}}
* In metagenome studies, the reads coming from the same run (also in the same file) are from different cells, which brings troubles to assembly. 
* In single-cell studies, the reads are expected to be from the DNA of a single cell. However there might be contamination.
