## Literature Review

Sequencing microbiome genome provides insights in understanding biological and medical problems, such as evaluating abundance of bacteria and spotting the unknown from environmental samples {{Yu 2017}}, reconstructing human microbiome and revealing their connections to lifestyle {{Pasolli 2019}}, etc. Such studies require practicing of the Next-Generation genome sequencing, which concerns technological challenges in both biological and computational aspects. {{Gawad 2015}}

There are two types of microbiome studies depending on the genome subjects: (a) single-cell, which performs sequencing on isolated individual cells or species {{Gawad 2015, Tringe 2005}} and (b) metagenome whose subject is the microbial community in the environment {{Tringe 2005}}. 

In both cases, the current-state sequencing methods produce data in large scales and advanced algorithms in combinatorics and data science must be employed to make efficient and effective use of the biological data.
