### Recovering Genomes

The major challenges for recovering genomes from the single cell sequencing data are as follows:

* Information in each cell is not enough to cover the whole genome of the corresponding species, and thus combining the information of cells of the same species is necessary. The common practice is co-assembly.
* The huge amount of cells brings trouble to a few operations, such as co-assembly and clustering.
* The biochemistry methods brings artifacts to data, including bias of sequencing depth over coverage, contamination and noises. {{Shapiro 2013}}

To achieve the goal with high computational efficiency, we propose a new
